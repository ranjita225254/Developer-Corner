The focus is on ensuring daily operational reliability of clean water sources combined with transformation of hygiene and sanitation committees. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have been structured to include local private sector "micro-utilities" as key performance-paid players,  and to include local government offices and NGOs. A laddered strategy for local community financing of sustainable WASH services has been established. </p>

                            <p>Whave experts have been leading contributors to development of rural electricity network in Sri Lanka through design, construction, and rehabilitation of numerous micro-hydro sites. These have included stand-alone as well as grid connected sites, and several village-scale power stations. Whave has also designed and introduced high efficiency tea processing equipment, to reduce fuel-wood and fossil-fuel consumption.</p>

                            <p>Whave experts assisted the Government to revise electricity laws and regulations in order to facilitate a range of rural electrification initiatives led by provincial energy service companies. We established a credit and hire-purchase system which enabled local entrepreneurs to install and operate reliably solar PV in 5 provinces, and also to provide reliable operation and management for village-scale pico-hydro systems. The work involved effective participative planning and incentives for regular preventive maintenance.</p>

This was applied to a CDM Programme of Activities in Bangladesh, where we designed and undertook the baseline study and a field performance test of improved stoves using firewood, and developed the CDM PoA and CPA Design Documents. The PoA was registered in 2011 as the first CDM PoA for improved cook-stoves. </p>
